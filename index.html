        <h3>Ant colony</h3>
        <p>A queen ant and several male ants will leave the original colony on a nuptial flight. When the ants find a suitable spot, they land, discard their wings and begin building a new nest. Eventually, the worker ants will build the colony around the queen who will set about laying eggs so the colony can grow.</p>

            <h1>Inside the Ant Colony</h1>
        <p>The success and survival of ants is due to their social nature.  Just like humans, there is strength in numbers. What makes the existence of ants strong and everlasting is a combination of three biological traits:  adults care for the young; two or more generations of adults live together in the same colony; and the members are divided into a reproductive “royal” caste and a non-reproductive “worker” caste.  This social organization of the ant colony has given ants a competitive edge that has dominated the world.</p>

                <p >Inside the Ant Tunnel Inside the tunnels and caverns of a ant colony are a large working caste of wingless, sterile females and reproductive caste of winged, fertile males and females (virgin queens) and usually one fertile, egg-producing queen.  The queen relies on her workers for food and protection. Workers are responsible for building and maintaining the nest, guarding the queen and larvae from intruders, gathering food, tending eggs, larvae, pupae, and even feeding the queen.    Each colony has its own distinct odor, which determines recognition among its members and repels any outsiders</p>
